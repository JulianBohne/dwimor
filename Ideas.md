- Text magic eye ~ Credit: @Cookiemonster@chaos.social
    - Derivative Idea: Resolution is p*q, where p and q are primes -> Just one file without line breaks should be enough to figure it out -> CTF???
- Track head position and feed it into the shaders, so the magic eye works from other angles
- Refractions / Reflections possible?
